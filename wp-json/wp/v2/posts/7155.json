Quite a few of us in the CB office have now visited Florence in order to experience its world-class wine culture, and, having loved it, we thought we would share some of our insights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>OVERALL TRENDS<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Respect and pride for local Tuscan wines, which most offerings will consist of.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A unique culture of \u2018Wine Windows\u2019 scattered across the city.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Plenty of natural, organic, or otherwise sustainable micro-producers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Celebrating the marriage between Tuscany\u2019s wines and the locally produced food.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>WINE WINDOWS<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WINE WINDOWS OF FLORENCE<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"601\" height=\"401\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/image.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7156 lazyload\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 601px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 601\/401;width:400px\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/image.jpg 601w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2025\/03\/image-300x200.jpg.webp 300w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most famous thing about Florence\u2019s wine scene is the prevalence of the idiosyncratic and much-photographed <em>Buchettas<\/em>, small windows designed in the 16<sup>th<\/sup> century for the newly deregulated sale of goods, specifically so that the servants of Florentine\u2019s elite could sell off their Master\u2019s wines in an easy manner, without needing to permit entry to the estate. Due to wine being one of the more common usages, they have become known by foreigners as \u2018wine windows\u2019, despite being used to sell a variety of goods such as gelato, bread, and other Italian delicacies. Even after falling out of use, and many being bricked up over the course of the next centuries, a few are still used today, and constitute a very memorable part of Florence\u2019s 3000 year old wine story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>BAR HOPPING<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/Babae.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7163 lazyload\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1024px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1024\/768;width:250px\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/Babae.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2025\/03\/Babae-300x225.jpg.webp 300w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2025\/03\/Babae-768x576.jpg.webp 768w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Babae Florence<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Location: Via Santo Spirito, 21R, 50125<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vibe: Cozy, intimate, elegant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Known for: Probably Florence\u2019s most famous \u2018wine-window\u2019, great selection of food &amp; wine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"276\" height=\"184\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/image-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7157 lazyload\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 276px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 276\/184;width:250px\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Enoteca Pitti Gola e Cantina<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Location: Piazza de' Pitti, 16, 50125<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vibe: Elegant, modest, welcoming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Known for: Using ingredients and dishes from Tuscan regions, pairing them with wines from the same area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"276\" height=\"152\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/image-3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7159 lazyload\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 276px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 276\/152;width:250px\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vineria Sonora<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Location: Via degli Alfani, 39R, 50121<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vibe: Quaint, passionate, rustic, trendy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Known for: Wide range of lesser-known producers, as well as many natural &amp; organic wines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"256\" height=\"171\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/image-4.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7160 lazyload\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 256px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 256\/171;width:250px\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>First Glass<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Location: Lungarno degli Acciaiuoli, 6R, 50125<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vibe: Modern, oenophilic, educational.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Known for: Serving sample-bottles so you can try and learn about as many interesting wines as you want.<strong><br><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>WINE AS ART<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PRODUCER BIBI GRAETZ<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"601\" height=\"401\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/image-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7161 lazyload\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 601px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 601\/401;width:500px\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/image-1.jpg 601w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2025\/03\/image-1-300x200.jpg.webp 300w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As a city full of rich architecture and extensive museums, wine contributes a large part to Florence\u2019s artistic tapestry. Last year, our Head of Operations, Sophie Burleigh travelled to Florence to visit one of our favourite innovative wineries, Bibi Graetz, and you can read the specifics of her trip <a href=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/articles\/bibi-graetz-and-the-art-of-winemaking\/\">here<\/a>. Bibi Graetz is first and foremost an artist; as the son of Swiss-Israeli sculptor Gidon Graetz, Bibi quickly gravitated towards the visual art mediums, thereafter becoming a painter himself, whose work can now be found adorning not only his bottles, but the many walls across his winery as well. When you experience Bibi\u2019s wine\u2019s, it is clear that this artistry, this passion for colour, tone, hue, texture, remains with him up to this day, and has simply found another suitable channel in the world of wine-making; with the grapes as his canvas, and his assiduously developed techniques as his brush, he continues to be just as evocative, passionate, and visionary in his wine as he was in his painting. Inside the brightly-labelled bottles, you will find wines as lush and impressionistic as the art which surrounds them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One anecdote which I think captures Bibi\u2019s passion and extravagance, surrounds a wine he released in 2020 entitled <em>\u2018Soffocone\u2019<\/em>\u00b8which, once you have acquired the translation, you will understand why there was a bit of a furore \u2014 one perhaps not helped by its label design: a tranquil storm of opulent curvature, swirled into the figure of woman, no doubt in preparation for the act the wine\u2019s title refers to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only a 20-minute drive from Florence, Bibi Graetz is just one of the many amazing producers in the area willing and ready to accept visitors, and share their love for all things oenological.
