In fact, the wine culture there has grown so considerably in the past decade, that a couple of years back Star Wine List eventually launched their Wine Guide for the city, highlighting the growing scene. As far as their tastes go, there is a noticeable, and perhaps slightly predictable preoccupation with South African wines, and many of the bars and restaurants are using their presence to establish and showcase smaller producers from the country, especially those using low-intervention wine making, and classic grapes from the area, like Pinotage and Chenin Blanc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>OVERALL TRENDS<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Focus on small-batch, local, South African producers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>An appreciation for low-intervention winemaking, and single-varietal wines.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pan-Asian food is quite popular there, especially with wine-oriented establishments.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Plenty of Champagne and sparkling wines.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>WOMEN OF WINE<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ACID FOOD &amp; WINE BAR<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"364\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/image.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11968 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/image.jpg 600w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2025\/04\/image-300x182.jpg.webp 300w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 600px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 600\/364;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Leading the charge in Johannesburg\u2019s focus on small-batch, minimalist, organic wine producers are Acid Food &amp; Wine Bar, founded and run by sommelier Jemma Styer and chef Jes Devoton, who pride themselves on bringing quality, light-heartedness, and ultimately joy to the masses. Much of their wine-list focuses on female-led wineries from the country, something especially important considering the male dominance in South African wine production, as well as the bar and restaurant industry as a whole. Their wine list is rapidly changing, and fresh, given the small quantities produced by their partners, and they even offer every wine by-the-glass in order to foster as much curiosity and freedom as they can when exploring South Africa\u2019s undeniably exciting wine-making.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their food menu is equally enticing, and utilises Devoton\u2019s Thai heritage to bring in a strong Southeast-Asian influence to their use of local ingredients, and many years of self-taught experience, creating what she herself calls \u2018global food\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have, unfortunately, temporarily closed their doors whilst they restructure and prepare for the next stage of their evolution \u2014 so if you are in the area, keep your eyes peeled for their next steps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>BAR HOPPING<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"269\" height=\"145\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/image-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11969 lazyload\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 269px;

They live by the motto \u2018Wine tastes better when you understand it\u2019, and everything they do is tailored around this. They believe in supporting wines which do not rely on brand-recognition to succeed, but rather are always on the hunt for lesser-known, more exciting, and most importantly delicious wines. Not only is he operating across South Africa, but intends to inject the vibrancy of their wine culture into his homeland of Zimbabwe, which he considers seriously neglected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharing Marume\u2019s passion and excitement for South African wines, we really enjoy looking at their red wines, seeing as they are very much known for their whites, and <a href=\"https:\/\/cbuncorked.com\/wine\/paserene-union-2019\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Paserene Union 2019<\/strong><\/a><strong> <\/strong>is a great example of the complexity they can achieve, with a rich tannin structure, plenty of dark ripe fruit, and undertones of smoke, charcoal, wood, and a pleasant bitter floral finish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Each month in our \u2018Spotlight On\u2026\u2019 series, we explore a new city and its wine culture, diving into the drinking trends, where to go for great wines, and any unique products or services linked to the region.
