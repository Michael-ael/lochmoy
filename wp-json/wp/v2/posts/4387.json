For several years we have been working with the Gaja brand and incorporating it as part of our clients' portfolios. Going back to July 2023 our Founder and Director, Enzo Giannotta highlighted the importance to our CB clients to include Italian wines as part of a bigger portfolio approach (click <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/why-italy-enzo-giannotta\/?trackingId=eWBycozmT8CCzaiwEcufAQ%3D%3D&amp;_kx=BMAN_1pnk58wZfSuQjI9C9eoKVKcfnBSbaWfFq2IzaA.SC892k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a> to read more). This recommendation\/suggestion has been vindicated as per today\u2019s results for the whole of 2024.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Italian producer Gaja took the runner-up spot on Liv-ex's Power 100 list 2024*. The brand was 38th in the 2022 list and 7th in 2023, so it has been building up momentum in recent years. Liv-ex said that Gaja has been \u2018carefully and consistently built up over decades\u2019 and \u2018is well known and trusted\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liv-ex ranked each brand in four key categories: year-on-year price performance (12 months to 30 September 2024), trading performance on Liv-ex, the number of wines and vintages traded, and the average price of the wines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Italy is snapping at the heels of Bordeaux and Burgundy in terms of brand representation in the top 100. The country made the strongest gains in this year\u2019s top 100 list, filling 22 spots, up from just 13 last year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"810\" height=\"470\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Gaja-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4389 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Gaja-3.jpg 810w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/12\/Gaja-3-300x174.jpg.webp 300w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/12\/Gaja-3-768x446.jpg.webp 768w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 810px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 810\/470;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018While Tuscany, and in particular Brunello, has made the greatest gains, a deeper look reveals a far from homogenous set of Italian producers that have entered the list this year,\u2019 said Liv-ex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018As confidence has dissipated from the market, participants have gravitated towards brands that represent the least risky bets, [\u2026] Brands which share many stereotypically Bordelaise traits have risen to the top.'<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018Volume, liquidity, heritage brand and prices that invite the uncorking of bottles are their calling cards. With the market still looking for a turning point [following two years of declining sales for fine wine], it is unlikely participants will be changing tack just yet.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gaja has climbed the rankings. 38th in the 2022 list, 7th in 2023, and now 2nd. The Gaja brand, carefully and consistently built up over decades, is well known and trusted. This is reflected in the breadth of Gaja wines that trade. 70 different vintages of 13 different brands have changed hands over the past 12 months. As an added bonus, it is one of the 11 brands in the Power 100 whose average price has not fallen over the past year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When looking for liquidity, low cost, high performance, maximum security\/minimum downside risk and something that has instant approachability in terms of its drinking window, as well as the ability to age effortlessly for up to 50 years, covering short \u2013 medium \u2013 long term goals, Italy covers every angle for you and your funds in 2025 and beyond.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>*Liv-Ex, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.liv-ex.com\/2024\/12\/2024-liv-ex-power-100-low-can-go\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Power 100 2024<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Announced this morning as one of the most powerful fine wine brands in the world, via the largest wine trading platform in the world -Liv-ex- the brand from Piedmont, Italy which has stormed the Power 100 list: Gaja.
