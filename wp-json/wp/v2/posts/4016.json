They are securing blue-chip products at a discount to their market high, ready for the next growth cycle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Domaine Armand Rousseau Chambertin 2010<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"442\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/11\/TA2-1024x442.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4018 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/11\/TA2-1024x442.png.webp 1024w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/11\/TA2-300x129.png.webp 300w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/11\/TA2-768x331.png.webp 768w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/TA2.png 1416w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1024px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1024\/442;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Blue-chip products like the 2010 Domaine Armand Rousseau Chambertin have reached relative stability as the fine wine market approaches a turning point. This presents exciting opportunities for new investment in brands that have proven their ability to grow in value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Explore the Opportunity: Get ahead of the curve by investing in established wines from Burgundy, Bordeaux, and Champagne. Our experts can guide you through choosing vintages and producers with the best potential for long-term growth.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Spurred by falling prices, we have seen more buyers and sellers than ever. According to Liv-Ex, August saw a \u2018<em>jump in trade value, volume and number of new buyers; there was a 9.8% and 9.9% rises in the number of unique brands and wines traded on the market during that month.\u2019<\/em>*<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In past reports, we highlighted a 500% increase in new bidders at fine wine auctions over the past 10 years**. That trend has persisted in periods of growth and during corrections. At times, demand accelerates when prices fall, allowing us to anticipate where our clients should invest before a market or specific product increases in value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first half of 2024, Acker Auction House reported a 15% increase in sale volumes and nearly 5,000 new world records***. This is amid the current market softening, so the question now is, will this growing demand spur the next growth cycle?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Look at Market Dynamics<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Global economic pressures have weighed down the fine wine market. The aftermath of the global pandemic, escalating inflation, currency fluctuations, and the ongoing Ukraine conflict collectively shaped the market's trajectory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since peaking after the pandemic, prices across top wine indices, such as the Liv-ex 100 and the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50, have steadily decreased. As of September, the Liv-ex 100 index was down 1.7% month-over-month and 7% year-to-date, with Bordeaux and Burgundy among the hardest-hit categories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Liv-ex 100 over 2 years<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"442\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/11\/TA3-1024x442.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4019 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/11\/TA3-1024x442.png.webp 1024w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/11\/TA3-300x129.png.webp 300w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/11\/TA3-768x331.png.webp 768w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/TA3.png 1384w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1024px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1024\/442;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While some buyers stepped back, others have recognised this downturn as a valuable entry point.

Leading industry analysts at the London International Vintners Exchange (Liv-ex) note positive price movement in select Burgundy names and top-end Champagnes, while premium Bordeaux vintages like the acclaimed 2009s and 2010s appear to be reaching price floors.* Flagship Burgundy labels like DRC and Rousseau have stabilised, offering 30-40% discounts from recent peaks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Romanee-Conti Grand Cru average UK retail price per 75cl<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"441\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/11\/TA4-1024x441.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4020 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/11\/TA4-1024x441.png.webp 1024w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/11\/TA4-300x129.png.webp 300w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/11\/TA4-768x331.png.webp 768w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/TA4.png 1371w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1024px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1024\/441;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wine Lister's report shows that the market is signaling a low point, especially in these high-quality, historically resilient categories.**** These indicators suggest a valuable opportunity to secure high-quality wines at rare, low prices that may not last long.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2025 Market Outlook: Is This the Low-Buying Window?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking forward, the fine wine market appears set for stabilisation and recovery as we enter 2025. Following the recent correction, industry experts expect prices to level out, and some anticipate a potential rebound by mid-year. As Liv-ex\u2019s head of broking, Robbie Stevens, points out, this latest price drop could be the \u201cpenny-drop moment\u201d the market needed to recalibrate.*<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you've been waiting for the right time to invest in fine wine, this could be the cyclical low savvy investors seek. Select categories may provide attractive returns as the market settles, especially as consumer interest grows in premium, finite products with a solid historical performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Ready to Invest?
