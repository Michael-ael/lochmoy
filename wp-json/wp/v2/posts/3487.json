Geographic differences highlighted in price movements, especially prices softening within Burgundy, have proved to be as much of an opportunity as a concern for many. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something to remember when digesting this report: Fine wine has thrown up some amazing short and mid-term gains for clients, but the real wins come from a longer-term approach. The key elements that drive the market only increase the likelihood of longer-term holds being well rewarded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent discussion with a prominent Californian wine maker, conversation turned to the inelastic supply of wines that we work with and how the \u2018luxury goods\u2019 element has such a growing influence within the market. During the chat, he mentioned a statistic that although didn\u2019t surprise me, did resonate and stick with me a while after; Upon a visit to Porsche, my esteemed associate was informed \u201cFor every 18 people who can afford a Porsche, we make 1\u201d. Best results come when you have a demand that\u2019s outstripping the supply. There are few markets where this can genuinely and exponentially increase as time goes by. Fine wine offers a truly diminishing supply of any given vintage with a growing audience of not only collectors but also casual investors and wine lovers. When making your assessment you must take into account the big picture and remember bravery in times of uncertainty or instability has often been rewarded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where this bravery is perhaps most clearly exemplified is in those who bought Sassicaia 1985. On release, in today\u2019s money, this wine would have cost \u20ac9.00 per bottle, with a current average bottle price of over \u20ac3,450 per bottle, equating to growth of over 38,000%. When looking at the graph below, the eye-watering performance of the wine is obvious in the years after it\u2019s release. But, without the privilege of hindsight, one has to wonder, what would I have done holding a case during this manic period of growth? The importance of the experience and guidance from a data and knowledge-driven company such as CB Wine cannot be understated when negotiating these times of volatility in a market than generally offers steady returns. It is with a market-literate portfolio manager by your side that the greatest returns achieved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"590\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/09\/chart-lafitte-cab-enzo-article-1024x590.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3493 lazyload\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1024px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1024\/590;width:840px;height:auto\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/09\/chart-lafitte-cab-enzo-article-1024x590.png.webp 1024w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/09\/chart-lafitte-cab-enzo-article-300x173.png.webp 300w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/09\/chart-lafitte-cab-enzo-article-768x442.png.webp 768w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/09\/chart-lafitte-cab-enzo-article-1536x885.png.webp 1536w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/09\/chart-lafitte-cab-enzo-article-2048x1179.png.webp 2048w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/chart-lafitte-cab-enzo-article.png 2622w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Would you have been happy with your returns at this point in Sassicaia\u2019s lifecycle?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Compared to Lafite\u2019s steep growth, how many brokers would have convinced their clients to sell Sassicaia here for underperformance?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Experiencing growth followed by a dip, would you have been brave enough to hold and experience further uplift?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What\u2019s next for Sassicaia?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In any industry, companies\u2019 efforts to gain interest from potential clients can unfortunately sometimes result in the use of hollow statistics and half-presented information.
