From exploring the wines lists of clubs such as <strong>New York Vintners<\/strong>, <strong>Casa Cipriani<\/strong>, and <strong>Aman New York<\/strong>, there are certain aspects each list has in common: classics, exclusives and untapped. Each seems to offer brands that are easy to identify as luxury, such as Dom Perignon and other Champagne brands.&nbsp; They also have exclusive picks, with smaller plot vineyards from fine wine brands, and backdated vintages. And finally, they all seem to offer something new, from less explored regions, or smaller production brands, to give all diners the chance to try something new (or more attractively, to try something no one else has).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another noticeable trend throughout club offerings, is their broadening in offerings from Italy. Nomad club <strong>The Ned <\/strong>offers an impressive range, from multiple regions, not only listing big super-Tuscan brands. <strong><em>Giacomo Conterno Arione 2015<\/em><\/strong> features on their list, a wine with multiple impressive critic scores, boasting richness and density.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With access to the finest wines money can buy, the wines that make the wine list of an exclusive New York members\u2019 club should not go unnoticed, and the thorough offering of Italian wines should equally not be overlooked as a sign of things to come.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Each month in our \u2018Spotlight On\u2026\u2019 series, we explore a new city and its wine culture, diving into the drinking trends, where to go for great wines, and any unique products or services linked to the region.
