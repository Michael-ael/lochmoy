With its taxation benefits it is no wonder the number of High Net Worth Individuals bolstering their portfolios with fine wine has risen to 40%, with an average of 10% of their portfolios allocated to wine. With the addition of 96% of wealth advisors throughout the UK expecting the demand of fine wine to increase as well as the introduction of institutions now heavily investing into wine, the strengthening of this market is clear. This increase in confidence within the market should come as no surprise as the historical performances of wine and the strong liquidity that comes with a bottled consumable commodity is evident.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all markets, fine wine experiences cycles. Historical factors greatly influence these patterns, such as World War Two where prices rose by 600% while Germany occupied France, followed by a 50% collapse when the war was over. Similar cycles were witnessed in the 70s, 80s, 90s and more recently from the mid-2000s when China entered the market. Lessons have since been learnt from these incidences, fortifying the market with a greater ability to quell such dramatic corrections. The following explores the events that led to China\u2019s wide- reaching impact and discusses if other emerging economies can have a similar, if not greater effect on the market in years to come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">China\u2019s impact on the fine wine market<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During the mid-2000s when China entered the market we witnessed a series of significant macro-events that had an impact on wine prices. The sharpest increase in wine prices was between 2005 and 2011, after which a series of cut- downs completed the cycle of the Chinese-led influences. The below timeline demonstrates what effects were had on the market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Timeline of key events<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>July 2007: Hong Kong cut duty from 80% to 40%. March 2008: Hong Kong cut duty to 0%.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>November 2008: China announces economic stimulus programs: 4 trillion yuan of investments in areas such as infrastructure, transport, industry, tax cuts and finance. Chinese interest in fine wine, a popular gift among officials, steadily increases.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>October 2010: China\u2019s economic stimulus package was a success and purchases of luxury goods in the country were booming.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>July 2012: China announces a crack-down on gift-giving of luxury goods among government officials.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>July 2014: The market hits its lowest point since before the China-led boom.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>March 2021: China formally introduces tariffs on Australian wine.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In the midst of China\u2019s involvement, The Global Financial Crisis hit and did little to slow demand from China- in fact we witnessed the opposite. In the months following, China joined several major nations and announced a 4 trillion RMB stimulus package. Despite this, the financial markets remained skeptical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The En Primeur tastings of the 2008 vintage were poorly attended, and hopes were low with generous release prices on offer. However, after a glowing report from Robert Parker Jr. the enticing prices that were being offered soon vanished. The releases that followed came at the same level or at a premium to the previous vintage, and with that, the brief period of market weakness was over.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year later, when tasting the 2009 vintage at En Primeur, Parker famously declared that it \u2018may turn out to be the finest vintage I have tasted in 32 years of covering Bordeaux\u2019. The wines were subsequently released at record prices reflecting not just their quality but broad-based global demand, led in no small part by the vast sum of newly created wealth in mainland China.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With American buyers still recovering from the financial crisis and cellars recently topped up with 2009, many withdrew from the campaign expressing growing concerns that irrational exuberance had taken hold and Bordeaux was pricing itself out of the market. The 2010 release was at a 13% premium to the previous year and despite the concerns and withdrawal of American buyers, the effect of China\u2019s stimulus package was still being felt. A new generation of buyers had been born and purchases of luxury goods were booming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bordeaux had capitalised on a period of demand during economic uncertainty, but this success was soon to be outlived as China\u2019s government introduced a gift-giving ban* in an attempt from the Chinese government to tackle corruption and inequality of income distribution, leading to overnight demand collapsing. The Bordeaux market fell into a steep decline that endured for the next five years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">China\u2019s influence on the market today<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2010, the fine wine market has significantly expanded and China no longer has such immediate influence on pricing. We now see buying spikes ahead of Chinese New Year, with many purchasing wines from previous vintages of the same zodiac. Commemorative bottles continue to be released specifically for the Chinese market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite China not having the impact on the market that it once did, the potential has not gone away. Global powerhouses like Domaines Barons de Rothschild and LVMH continue to invest in their own Chinese vineyards. Although no longer shaping the market as it once did, we may see further cycles of influence from China directly. **<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However the wine world isn\u2019t laying dormant waiting on demand from countries such as China.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The market is becoming more and more globalised and as a country whose AlcoBev industry sits closely behind the USA and China, attentions are being turned to India as the next likely major influence that wine will experience. When a country with the 5th largest economy in the world is on track to be 3rd largest in 2030, you can understand why India is grabbing the attention of all industries. India as a population is young with 600 billion 18-35 year olds with strong educational backgrounds; this number is expected to grow by 100 million every 5 years. With this young demographic of cash rich individuals, it is not surprising that the luxury market is due to reach 200 billion by 2030- 3.5 times its current size. Growing alcohol consumption trends, adopted from western patterns, means the AlcoBev industry is expected to be worth 64 billion by 2030, totaling 2% of India's GDP. Alcohol is going to be a major industry as India continues to develop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are now 10 million Indians who drink wine regularly, and the wine consumption rate increased in India by 29% in 2022, averaging 14% per year over the last 5 years making it India\u2019s fastest AlcoBev market ahead of whisky. According to an India Wine Insider (IWI) report, India\u2019s wine market is now estimated to be valued at $238 million.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Indian palette has found red wine to be the most appealing despite the hot and humid conditions. The demand breakdown stands as;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1345\" height=\"1080\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/wine-consumption-india-type.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3468 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/wine-consumption-india-type.png 1345w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/09\/wine-consumption-india-type-300x241.png.webp 300w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/09\/wine-consumption-india-type-1024x822.png.webp 1024w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/09\/wine-consumption-india-type-768x617.png.webp 768w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1345px) 100vw, 1345px\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1345px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1345\/1080;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>India is also importing more wine with a 50% decrease in excise duty taxes on imported alcohol from 300% to 150% in 2021. According to Sonal Holland, the first and only Master of Wine in India, \u201cWines from Australia, Chile, Italy and France are among the top four destinations imported in India. U.S. are likely to gain popularity in years to come due to competitive pricing strategies and experiential marketing efforts to gain brand recall and loyalty among Indian consumers.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is no surprise then to see that the main imported wines are from Australia; However, as similar agreements for Australia are created with other wine producing regions, we would expect the prices of wines from France, Italy and Napa Valley to decrease, meaning we will most likely see these regions gain a bigger market share.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current division of import share by country into India is as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"820\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/09\/wine-consumption-india-region-1024x820.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3467 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/09\/wine-consumption-india-region-1024x820.png.webp 1024w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/09\/wine-consumption-india-region-300x240.png.webp 300w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/smush-webp\/2024\/09\/wine-consumption-india-region-768x615.png.webp 768w, https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/wine-consumption-india-region.png 1348w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1024px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1024\/820;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial forecasts for the wine market in India are positive. According to Business Insider, wine in India is expected to grow at 10% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) in volumes between 2024 and 2027. As Sonal Holland MW asserts during an interview with Liz Thach for Forbes in October last year;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cNot only is our wine consumption going up, so is the thirst for wine knowledge. Wine is the new media symbol of success, sophistication, and romance in India, making it a mainstream beverage in the country.\u201d***<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>-SONAL HOLLAND MW, OCT 2023<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What does this mean for the fine wine market?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is clear to see that India has the making to be a major global player within the fine wine industry, not only due to the fact that wine is a mainstream choice of beverage with the number of consumers set to increase year on year, but also the fact that one of the strongest demographics for the consumption of wine are professionals and educated young millennials. The influence of a younger population paving the way for India\u2019s wine market provides longevity within the<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>market. Wine will always be seen as a statement of wealth and sophistication. With a rapidly growing population, many will be seeking the finer things in life; and of course nothing is finer than a fine wine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What regions will see the most growth?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The regions which have been a mainstay in our industry such as Bordeaux and Burgundy will of course see strong growth potential as consumers will look towards the classics due to their worldwide reputation, drawing on western influences of wines which show a statement of wealth. What will be interesting to see is how Indian investors will respond to the experimental marketing adopted by Napa Valley, freed from the constraints of traditionalism that we see in the old world. Indian consumers are drawn to uniqueness in brands; As knowledge for what makes a good wine is becoming ever-more accessible, the majority of purchasing decisions will be based on marketing and brand awareness. There is no denying that some of the most experimental branding and eye-catching wines come from the Napa Valley. Alongside the impeccable quality that comes along and very limited production levels, the demand for the Napa Valley could be huge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here at Cult and Boutique we have been collecting high end Napa Valley wines for over a decade, a region that is very much still in its infancy, as demand in the secondary market continues to pick up here in the UK. The impacts of demand within this region have been heightened due to the region\u2019s minimal production levels. With a huge economy such as India expecting to turn towards wines from the Napa Valley, could we see a growth pattern similar to that of Burgundy over recent years?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prospect is certainly exciting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>*[Source:<\/em><em> <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-asia-china-21349722\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-asia-china-21349722]<\/em><\/a><em><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>**[Source:<\/em><em> <\/em><em>China\u2019s<\/em><em> <\/em><em>impact<\/em><em> <\/em><em>on<\/em><em> <\/em><em>the<\/em><em> <\/em><em>fine<\/em><em> <\/em><em>wine<\/em><em> <\/em><em>market<\/em><em> <\/em><em>-<\/em><em> <\/em><em>Liv-<\/em><em>ex]<\/em><em><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>***[Source:<\/em><em> <\/em><em>Wine<\/em><em> <\/em><em>In<\/em><em> <\/em><em>India<\/em><em> <\/em><em>\u2013<\/em><em> <\/em><em>Consumption<\/em><em> <\/em><em>Rates<\/em><em> <\/em><em>Increasing<\/em><em> <\/em><em>Along<\/em><em> <\/em><em>With<\/em><em> <\/em><em>Wine<\/em><em> <\/em><em>Knowledge]<\/em><em><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discuss Further...<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get in touch with us to discuss this article further and learn more about emerging markets.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There is no doubt that the fine wine market has given comfort to savvy investors, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty, providing strong and stable returns.
