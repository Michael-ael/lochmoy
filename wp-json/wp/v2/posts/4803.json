The U.S. economy demonstrated robust growth, reminiscent of the 1980s, bolstered by business optimism and anticipated regulatory easing under the Trump administration.<a id=\"_ftnref1\" href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]<\/a> This economic vigor contributed to a 24% surge in the S&amp;P 500, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence and strong corporate earnings.<a id=\"_ftnref2\" href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]<\/a> Conversely, Europe faced economic challenges, with political uncertainties and sluggish growth dampening investor sentiment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One person\u2019s loss can be another\u2019s gain - this sentiment seems to be reflected in some trends within the market. Renewed confidence in the US and Asia based on increased investor wealth was highlighted in September when Acker auction house recorded their best regional result in Hong Kong for over two years.<a href=\"#_ftn3\" id=\"_ftnref3\">[3]<\/a> With confidence growing and potential tax cuts looming under the Trump administration, the levels of disposable income amongst HNWs could well increase. Should that be the case, more wealth is likely to be channelled into fine wine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year highlighted some stark differences in buyers\u2019 attitudes based on their geographical location, with US Auction house Ackers Regional Wine Indices listing Burgundy as the top producing region with sales up 7.80%, and Italy second from bottom only above Bordeaux at -4.00%. These results showed a stark difference to the results posted by Liv-ex (UK based) with the Italy 100 performing better than any other sub-index of the Liv-ex 1000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burgundy prices have dropped and a large % of the buyers, be it auction or domestic, are coming from the US with Liv-ex stating the number of US buyers to have increased by over 9% year-to-date, highlighting the difference in buyer confidence. This international variation has been witnessed in-house with more international clients, covering 5 continents, coming on board in 2024 that previous years. Surely the continued geographical variation that we witnessed in 2024 will continue into 2025 making auction exit an ever-more attractive option. Taking the advice of experts to try and isolate the best performing components of any given index to limit any losses will give any investor the best chance of growth on whichever continent has the most buoyant economy at any given time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the fine wine market in 2024 seemed to display overall price decline across all regions, investor activity when measured by country remains nuanced. Opportunities did arise for many with the arrival of a buyer\u2019s market at the beginning of H2. The following breakdown provides some context as to the market conditions as they currently stand, as well as showcasing the highlights and events of the second half of this year\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\"><strong>H2 2024 Summary<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>JULY<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Sotheby\u2019s first ever exclusive single-owner Burgundy sale smashed records at the top of July 2024.<\/strong> 175 lots from wine and art collector Pierre Chen were sold, with more than a third of the lots sold achieving prices above their high estimates.

Will the optimism felt by many in the US and Asia land at a level that will boost the less optimistic sellers in Europe? The spread between bid and offer in Q1 will be a key indicator as to how the year will unfold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we see more positivity in the US and Asia while seeing loses akin to the 1.7% decline of the leading benchmark LX100, its sharpest month-on-month decline since October 2023 (Q3 last year), we know that our selection process becomes even more important. As we have always selected wines from the very best available, 2025 will be a year where the already regimented criteria will need to become even more select, with more understanding of international markets, tastes and trends. Look out for our spotlight series focusing on the more prevalent wine loving cities, starting with NYC, in our Extraction reports.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even in the less optimistic performance of the UK and European markets, some signs show we could return to growth soon. Value might be down but volume of sales is up and this demand will be a huge part of the market\u2019s inevitable recovery. Regions to watch remain Tuscany, Piedmont, Napa Valley and smart buys in aged Bordeaux and undervalued Burgundy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenges of a buyer\u2019s market only pose opportunities for us as a company to show our clients the importance of experience and market knowledge, and the advice our portfolio managers can pass on. Our team is set to take on 2025.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"6250\" height=\"6250\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cbwine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/E-Sig-transparent-01.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4810 lazyload\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 6250px;
